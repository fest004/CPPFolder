An application has an entrypoint
An application needs to start somewhere, which is called the entrypoint
Set of code that happens when the application starts up
For example, C++ and C# has the main function 
Churn, in this example are dll files

When writing "Churn is born" to the console, the test application Application.cpp
made its own entrypoint with the main function. Ideally we want Churn to handle that 
itself


After the changes, Churn itself handles the entrypoint, making for less work for the 
Sandbox application, only having to create a Sandbox class and instance, and CreateApplication;
